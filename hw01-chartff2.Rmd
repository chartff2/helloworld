###Exercise 1: is your room tidy?
##Treatment Data
```{r}
download.file("http://stat385.thecoatlessprofessor.com/assets/hw/hw01/treatment_data.csv", destfile="treatment_data.csv")

treatment=read.csv("treatment_data.csv")

treatment

```

This data is not tidy. There are two variables: subject treatment, week observed, and whatever it is the numbers measure (for example, whatever it is that subject treatment 12 B got a score of 6.97 of in week 6).


Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
